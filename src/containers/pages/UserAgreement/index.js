              This Wyre + Rewards User Terms (this “Agreement”) is between you
              as the User (referenced herein as “you,” “your,” or “User”) and
              Wyre Payments, Inc. (“we,” “our” or “Wyre”). This Agreement
              governs your participation in the Wyre + Rewards Program described
              below (the “Wyre + Rewards Program”) accessible through the Wyre
              website or mobile application and the Wyre API (collectively, the
              “Site”). Please read this Agreement carefully. By participating
              in, or attempting to participate in the Wyre + Rewards Program,
              User acknowledges and agrees that User has read, understood and
              accepted all of the terms and conditions contained in this
              Agreement as well as our Privacy Policy . If User does not agree,
              User may not participate in the Wyre + Rewards Program and must
              immediately cease any participation in the Wyre + Rewards Program.
              We may amend this Agreement from time to time by posting a revised
              version of this Agreement to the Site and sending notice to the
              email associated with User’s Wyre + Rewards Account (if
              applicable), and may do so without advance notice to User.
              Accordingly, please review the Agreement posted at this location
              on a periodic basis. Each time User participates in the Wyre +
              Rewards Program, User agrees to be bound by the terms of the
              Agreement in effect at the time of User’s participation therein.
              If User does not agree to the revised terms, User is not permitted
              to participate in the Wyre + Rewards Program.
            </p>
            <p>
              THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES USER AND WYRE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BY
              BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURT, UNLESS USER
              CHOOSES TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS. PLEASE SEE
              SECTION 16 TITLED “DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND
              CLASS ACTION WAIVER” BELOW. UNLESS USER OPTS OUT OF THE
              ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THE TIME ALLOWED, USER WAIVES USER’S
              RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION, AND
              EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY SECTION 16, USER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING
              ANY CLAIMS IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

              “E-SIGN DISCLOSURE AND CONSENT,” AUTHORIZATION TO ELECTRONICALLY
              RECEIVE ANY AND ALL COMMUNICATIONS (DEFINED BELOW) IS A CONDITION
              OF PARTICIPATION IN THE Wyre + REWARDS PROGRAM, MEANING THAT IF
              USER REVOKES USER’S CONSENT TO RECEIVE SUCH COMMUNICATIONS
              ELECTRONICALLY USER UNDERSTANDS THAT USER MAY NOT CONTINUE TO

            </p>
            <p>
              As with any asset, the value of digital assets can go up or down,
              and there is a substantial risk that the value of any digital
              assets you designate for participation in the program and rewards
              may decrease in value at the time of withdrawal from the program
              or payment of rewards. Further, by opting to participate in the
              Wyre + Rewards Program, you are agreeing that amounts designated
              by User for participation in the program may be used by Wyre (or
              its designees) for any purpose, and there is a risk that Wyre may
              not be able to return all or a portion of any digital assets or
              pay accrued Rewards, and you could lose all such amounts to which
              you may be entitled under the terms of the program. This could
              happen for a variety of reasons, including if the assets were lent
              by Wyre or otherwise entrusted to other third parties and those
              parties defaulted on their obligations to Wyre, or other reasons
              affecting the general ability of Wyre to honor its obligations.
              User should carefully consider whether participating in the Wyre +
              Rewards Program is suitable for User in light of User’s financial
              condition, and the risk of potential loss. The Wyre + Rewards
              Program is not intended to be an offer of a security in any
              jurisdiction and Wyre + Rewards Program has not been registered
              under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or the laws of any state or
              other jurisdiction. Accordingly, you should assume for purposes of
              evaluating whether to participate in the Wyre + Rewards Program
              that the Wyre + Rewards Program is not subject to any protections
              under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. Wyre is not
              registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                Description of the Service. Through the Wyre + Rewards Program
                and for the purpose of encouraging customer loyalty, Wyre
                utilizes third party sites to provide rewards payments to Users
                who elect to contribute certain digital assets, as determined by
                Wyre (“Eligible Assets”). Wyre, itself or through selected third
                parties (“Developers”), will provide rewards to User at the
                then-current rewards rate based on the amount of the Eligible
                Assets that User contributes to the Wyre + Rewards Program (the
                “Participation Amount”) for so long as such participation
                continues. Eligible Assets may change from time to time in
                Wyre’s sole discretion. User acknowledges and agrees that, upon
                Wyre’s receipt of any Wyre + Participation Amount that User
                elects to contribute under the Wyre + Rewards Program, Wyre may
                use such Participation Amount for any purpose Wyre chooses. User
                has no rights to any profits or returns that Wyre may generate
                or receive through its use of any Participation Amount, and
                User’s sole rights are to receive rewards and have the
                Participation Amount returned. User further acknowledges that
                User is aware of and assumes all risks associated with the
                volatility of the market price of any Participation Amount that
                User may contribute to the Wyre + Rewards Program.

                We do not offer the Wyre + Rewards Program in all jurisdictions.
                Additional information regarding the Wyre + Rewards Program may
                be available and obtained through the Site. The Wyre + Rewards
                Program, and certain aspects of the Wyre + Rewards Program, may,
                as applicable, be delayed, restricted, forfeited, or ultimately
                unavailable due to certain laws and regulations governing the
                Wyre + Rewards Program as well as certain circumstances and
                conditions associated with User’s participation in the Wyre +
                Rewards Program.

              In order to participate in the Wyre + Rewards Program, User must
              (i) create a Wyre + Rewards Account (see Section 3 below for
              details), (ii) be a resident of a jurisdiction we serve and, if
              you are a natural person, (iii) be at least the age of majority

                1.Identity Verification. In order to participate in the Wyre +
                Rewards Program, User agrees to provide us with the information
                we request for the purposes of verifying User’s identity and
                detecting potential money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud
                or other financial crimes and permit us to keep a record of such
                information. User will need to complete certain verification
                procedures before User is permitted to participate in the Wyre +
                Rewards Program. User’s access to the Wyre + Rewards Program and
                the limits that apply to User’s participation therein, may be
                altered as a result of information collected about User on an
                ongoing basis. The information we request may include certain
                personal information, including, but not limited to, User’s
                name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth,
                taxpayer identification number, a government identification, and
                information regarding User’s bank account (such as the name of
                the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number).
                In providing us with this or any other information that may be
                required, User confirms that the information is accurate and
                authentic. User agrees to keep us updated if any of the
                information provided to us changes. User authorizes us to make
                inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we
                consider necessary to verify User’s identity or protect User
                and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take
                action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such
                inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, User acknowledges
                and agrees that User’s personal information may be disclosed to
                credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime
                agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in
                full. See our Privacy Policy for how we treat User’s data.

                2.OFAC Screening and Sanctions. Wyre complies with the economic
                sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the
                Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). As part of
                the identity verification process, Wyre will check User’s
                information against the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals and
                Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) and ensure that User is not
                operating in a jurisdiction subject to sanctions. Wyre will
                periodically check the information User provides to us against
                the SDN List to comply with our obligations under federal law.
                Wyre is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or
                indirect, that User may incur as a result of our compliance with
                applicable law, the guidance or direction of any regulatory
                authority or government agency, or any writ of attachment, lien,
                levy, subpoena, warrant or other legal order.

              Account Creation. In order to participate in the Wyre + Rewards
              Program, User must create a Wyre + Rewards user account through
              the Site (a “Wyre + Rewards Account”). In order to create a Wyre +
              Rewards Account, User agrees to follow the process set forth in
              Section 2. If you are an entity, the individual creating a Wyre +
              Rewards Account on your behalf confirms that he or she is
              authorized to enter into this Agreement on your behalf.

              Accredited Investors. In addition to the information required
              pursuant to Section 2, Wyre may request documentation to assess
              and verify User’s personal net worth or income in order to
              determine whether User is an “accredited investor” (as defined in
              Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933). This
              information may be reviewed by Wyre or by a third-party service
              provider to Wyre. Wyre may determine to offer User Wyre + Rewards
              Program services depending on whether User is an accredited
              investor.

              Account Security. USER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE
              CONFIDENTIALITY OF USER’S ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS AND IS FULLY
              RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR UNDER USER’S
              Wyre + REWARDS ACCOUNT. User agrees to notify Wyre immediately if
              User knows of or suspects unauthorized use of User’s Wyre +
              Rewards Account or any other security breach, such as loss, theft,
              unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized use of User’s Wyre +
              Rewards Account, password or other access credentials. Wyre is not
              responsible for any losses, damages, costs, expenses or claims
              that result from stolen or lost passwords or other access
              credentials or any unauthorized use of User’s Wyre + Rewards
              Account. While Wyre has endeavored to make the Site secure and
              reliable, User should understand that the confidentiality of any
              communication or material transmitted to/from us using the Site
              over the Internet or other form of global communication network
              cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, Wyre is not responsible for the
              accuracy, reliability, or security of any information transmitted
              to or from us using the Site.

              Participation Terms. Terms may be disclosed on our site or
              Developers’ site; it is your sole responsibility to review and
              evaluate any and all applicable terms. For the avoidance of doubt,
              no erroneous or contrary information provided to User by any
              Developer or third party shall obligate Wyre to provide rewards on
              terms other than those specified on the Site at the time the
              Participation Amount is contributed. Such terms may address what
              we will accept as a contribution of a Participation Amount, which
              may include (i) each Eligible Asset, (ii) the reward we will pay
              (the “Wyre + Rewards Rates”), and (iii) any minimum or maximum
              amounts of Eligible Assets we will accept. If Wyre makes any
              changes to Wyre + Rewards Rates or other terms, Users may be
              notified through Users’ Wyre + Rewards Accounts page. For the
              avoidance of doubt, no erroneous or contrary information provided
              to User by any Developer or third party shall obligate Wyre to
              provide rewards on terms other than those specified on the Site at
              the time the Participation Amount is contributed. The current list
              of Eligible Assets can be found here [WEBSITE OR HYPERLINK], which
              will be updated periodically with any changes. Participation
              Amounts provided to Wyre are subject to the same market
              fluctuations as any other digital asset and User accepts that
              Participation Amounts lent to Wyre may lose value during the time
              that any Participation Amount is outstanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participation. If User desires to participate in the Wyre +
              Rewards Program, User must deliver the relevant Eligible Assets to
              Wyre in the time and manner specified by Wyre. Upon making such
              transfer, User has transferred all right, title and interest in
              and to the Eligible Assets delivered to Wyre. Wyre can use the
              Eligible Assets for any purpose we choose, and User has no rights
              to any profits or returns we may generate or receive through our
              use of such Eligible Assets, or otherwise to any compensation
              except the agreed-upon Wyre + Rewards Rate. If User contributes
              Eligible Assets, Wyre will confirm receipt thereof and reflect the
              type and amount of Eligible Assets contributed, and the Wyre +
              Rewards Rate to be paid, on User’s Wyre + Rewards Account page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repayment of Participation Amount. Unless otherwise specified,
              Participation Amounts will not have a set maturity date (i.e., a
              date when the Participation Amount is due in full). Wyre may, in
              its sole discretion, prepay the Participation Amount at any time
              without penalty and User can demand payment of the entirety or a
              portion of the Participation Amount, subject to the terms of this
              Agreement. Wyre will update User’s Wyre + Rewards Account page to
              reflect any changes in Participation Amounts a User has made.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Wyre determines to repay all or a portion of a Participation
              Amount, we will so notify User and will pay any Rewards Rate
              payment that is due and payable at the time and date of such
              repayment.
            </p>
            <p>
              If User demands payment of some or all of a Participation Amount,
              User must provide a destination wallet address (which may be a
              Wyre wallet). Wyre will return the requested Participation Amount
              plus any Wyre + Rewards Rate payment accumulated through the date
              that the User claims their participation amount within three
              business days to the wallet address provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Termination of Participation. Participation in the Wyre + Rewards
              Program with respect to a Participation Amount will terminate upon
              Notice from Wyre that it intends to repay the Participation Amount
              or from User demanding such repayment. Upon termination of
              participation, User must provide a destination wallet address
              (which may be a Wyre-provided wallet) and Wyre will deliver all
              Eligible Assets subject to the Participation Amount (plus any Wyre
              + Rewards Rate payment accumulated at the time of termination) to
              User at such wallet address.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repayment of Participation Amount in Illiquid Market. If the
              market for the Eligible Asset for the Participation Amount becomes
              illiquid (as determined by Wyre in its good faith discretion based
              on the trading of such Eligible Asset on the three highest volume
              digital asset exchanges) on the termination date of for the
              Participation Amount, User and Wyre will engage in good faith
              negotiations to reach an agreement regarding a substitute form of
              repayment for the affected Participation Amount. Any decision
              reached will be binding on User.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Payment of Rewards. Wyre agrees to pay User the Wyre + Rewards
              Rate on each Participation Amount. Wyre + Rewards Rate payments
              are earned and paid in the same type of digital asset as the
              applicable Participation Amount. All rates are displayed in APY
              compounding monthly. Wyre + Rewards Rate amounts are payable in
              arrears and added to the total principal balance of each
              Participation Amount (and thus included for purposes of
              calculating the amount of additional Wyre + Rewards Rate payments
              accrued). Participation Amounts will begin accruing Wyre + Rewards
              Rate amounts on the first full calendar day of their term. Wyre
              may change its Wyre + Rewards Rates at any time in its sole
              discretion. If User does not demand payment of a Participation
              Amount that is subject to a revised Wyre + Rewards Rate within
              three (3) calendar days of Wyre posting notice of such changes,
              User is deemed to have accepted the revised Wyre + Rewards Rate
              for User’s Participation Amount on a going-forward basis. Wyre +
              Rewards Rate payments made to User is not determined based on
              Wyre’s income or profit, or generated, directly or indirectly, as
              a result of Wyre’s use of a particular digital asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Calculation. We use the daily balance method to calculate the Wyre
              + Rewards Rate amounts owed to User. This method applies a daily
              periodic rate to the principal amount of the Participation Amount
              on each day. The daily periodic rate is calculated by dividing
              User’s applicable Wyre + Rewards Rate by the number of days in the
              year. We may round certain amounts that may not compound. Wyre +
              Rewards Rate payment amounts will be credited to User’s
              Participation Amount principal on the first business day of each
              calendar month for the Wyre + Rewards Rate payment amounts accrued
              during the preceding calendar month. Rewards are calculated daily
              based on the wallet balance at 11 pm UTC of that day and added to
              pending rewards. Pending rewards are released to the saving wallet
              at the end of each month.
            </p>
            <p>
              TAXES AND REPORTING. User is solely responsible for the reporting
              of Wyre + Rewards Rate rewards amounts earned, any payment of, and
              all taxes associated therewith earned from User’s contributed
              Participation Amount. While Wyre may provide User with statements
              and other documentation regarding User’s contributed Participation
              Amounts, Wyre shall bear no responsibility nor liability for any
              of User’s tax reporting or payment obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              INTENT. Both User and Wyre agree that Participation Amounts are
              intended to enable participation in Wyre + Rewards Program, in
              which Wyre provides rewards to User at the designated Wyre +
              Rewards rate. The parties do not intend such participation or the
              Wyre + Reward Program to be securities under the U.S. federal or
              state securities laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Wyre and User each represent and
              warrant that it has the power to execute and deliver this
              agreement, to make and accept the Participation Amounts as
              contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder, and
              that it is in compliance with applicable law. Wyre and User both
              represent that they will each make their own independent decisions
              to make or accept the contributions of the Participation Amounts
              and own determination as to whether the contribution of such
              Participation Amounts is appropriate or proper.

              TERMINATION. Wyre, in its sole discretion, may suspend or

              participation in the Wyre + Rewards Program, for any reason,

              subpoena, court order or other binding order from a government
              authority requiring us to do so or if we believe User has violated
              this Agreement, in letter or in spirit. Wyre may also, in its sole
              discretion, discontinue providing the Wyre + Rewards Program, or
              any part thereof, with or without notice. Unless otherwise
              directed by a governmental authority, in the event Wyre determines

              in the Wyre + Rewards Program or to discontinue the Wyre + Rewards
              Program, we will repay all Participation Amounts in full and
              direct such payment to the destination wallet address User
              provides to us. User may terminate this Agreement by demanding
              repayment of all outstanding Participation Amounts and requesting
              that we close User’s Wyre + Rewards Account, either by contacting
              Wyre at

                Dispute. Similarly, we will undertake reasonable efforts to
                contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to
                resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any
                formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual
                or potential Dispute (the “Notifying Party”) will include in
                that notice (a “Notice of Dispute”) your name (to the extent
                known), the Notifying Party’s contact information for any
                communications relating to such Dispute (including for the
                Notifying Party’s legal counsel if it is represented by counsel
                in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient details
                regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the “Notified
                Party”) to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns
                raised. If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) business
                days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and
                willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to
                resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly
                participate in such discussions in good faith.
              </li>
              <li>
                If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party’s compliance with all of
                its obligations under the preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not
                resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or
                if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute
                within ten (10) business days), the Notifying Party may initiate
                an arbitration proceeding as described below. If either party
                purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a
                Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its
                obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding
                any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will
                promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the
                other party all of its costs and expenses (including reasonable
                attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate as provided
                below, you and we each agree to resolve any Disputes that are
                not resolved informally as described above through final and
                binding arbitration as discussed herein, subject to the
                exceptions set forth below.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you do not wish to be subject to this agreement to arbitrate,
                you may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending a
                written notice to us at 9100 S. Dadeland Blvd Suite 1500 Miami
                FL 33156 or via e-mail at help@sendwyre.com within thirty (30)
                days of the first time you accept this Agreement (or any prior
                version of this Agreement) or, if earlier, your first use of any
                of our Services. You must date the notice and include your first
                and last name, address, and a clear statement that you do not
                wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. If no
                notice is submitted in the manner described above by the 30-day
                deadline, you will have irrevocably waived your right to
                litigate any Dispute except with regard to the exceptions set
                forth below. By opting out of this agreement to arbitrate, you
                will not be precluded from using any Services, but you and we
                will not be permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to
                arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided
                herein.
              </li>
              <li>
                You and we agree that the American Arbitration Association
                (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer
                Arbitration Rules in effect at the time arbitration is sought
                (“AAA Rules”), except that if any provision of this agreement to
                arbitrate conflicts with the AAA Rules, the provision of this
                agreement to arbitrate will control. The AAA Rules are available
                at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party
                who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
                with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
                Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.)
                Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be
                handled by a sole arbitrator. The single arbitrator will be
                either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law
                and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of
                arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
                arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand
                for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in
                accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator(s) shall be
                authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief,
                that would be available in an individual lawsuit, other than
                remedies that you effectively waived pursuant to this Agreement.
                Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this paragraph,
                if a party seeks injunctive relief that would significantly
                impact other of our customers or users, as reasonably determined
                by either party, such arbitration will proceed on an individual
                basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.
                In that event, each party shall select one arbitrator, and the
                two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who shall
                serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson shall be
                a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law with
                experience arbitrating or mediating disputes in the financial
                services industry. In the event of disagreement as to whether
                the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the
                sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this paragraph
                shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a
                three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if
                selected by either party or as the chair by the two
                party-selected arbitrators – participate in the arbitral panel.
                Except as may be and to the extent otherwise required by law,
                the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.
              </li>
              <li>
                ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE INITIATED WITHIN
                ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMPLAINING PARTY DISCOVERS THE FACTS THAT
                FORM THE BASIS FOR THE CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM, OR THE RIGHT TO
                BRING AN ARBITRATION BASED ON THOSE FACTS IS FOREVER WAIVED BY
                THAT PARTY.
              </li>
              <li>
                You and we further agree that the arbitration will be held in
                the English language in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if you so
                elect, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference,
                telephonically or via other remote electronic means. If we elect
                arbitration, we shall pay all of the AAA filing costs and
                administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect
                arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than
                hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules, or
                in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the AAA
                Rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or
                less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration,
                and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the
                arbitrator(s) finds that either the substance of your claim or
                the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper
                purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
                of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be
                determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Each party shall
                bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise
                provided herein or required by law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regardless of the rules of any arbitration forum, you and we
                agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an
                individual basis, and neither you nor we may bring a claim as a
                part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or
                mass arbitration (each, a “Collective Arbitration”). Without
                limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any
                Dispute against us will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if
                (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed
                concurrently; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same,
                share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. “Concurrently”
                for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are
                pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither you
                nor we shall be entitled to consolidate, join or coordinate
                disputes by or against other individuals or entities with any
                Disputes, or to arbitrate or litigate any Dispute in a
                representative capacity, including as a representative member of
                a class or in a private attorney general capacity. In connection
                with any Dispute, any and all such rights are hereby expressly
                and unconditionally waived. Without limiting the foregoing, any
                challenge to the validity of this paragraph or otherwise
                relating to the prohibition of Collective Arbitration shall be
                determined exclusively by the arbitrator.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notwithstanding this agreement between you and us to arbitrate
                Disputes, you and we each retain the following rights:
              </li>
              <li>
                13.This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or
                expiration of this Agreement. With the exception of the
                provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit
                Collective Arbitration, if a court or arbitrator decides that
                any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or
                unenforceable under applicable law, then the remaining portions
                of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid
                and in force. If a court or arbitrator decides that the
                prohibition of Collective Arbitration is invalid or
                unenforceable under applicable law, then the entirety of this
                agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions
                of this Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and
                any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court.

                Communications in Writing. All Communications in either
                electronic or paper format from us to User will be considered
                “in writing.” User should print or download for User’s records a
                copy of this Agreement and any other Communication that is
                important to User.
              </li>
              <li>
                Method of Providing Communications to User in Electronic Form.
                All Communications that we provide to User in electronic form
                will be provided either (i) via e-mail, (ii) by access to a web
                site that we will designate in an email notice we send to User
                at the time the information is available, or (iii) to the extent
                permitted by law, on the Site or via SMS text message. User
                agrees to promptly review all Communications sent to User, and
                that these are reasonable procedures for sending and receiving
                electronic communications.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to Update User’s Records. To receive electronic
                Communications, at the time that User first participates in the
                Wyre + Rewards Program, User must provide us with a true,
                accurate and complete email address and User’s other contact
                information, and User must promptly notify us of any changes to
                this information. User can update information (such as User’s
                email address) through the Site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hardware and Software Requirements. In order to access, view,
                and retain electronic Communications that we make available to
                User, User must have an electronic device that enables access to
                User’s e-mail account or a commercially available Internet
                browser. User may wish to utilize a device that is capable of
                storing or printing the Communications for User’s records.
              </li>
              <li>
                questing Paper Copies. Unless User has withdrawn consent to
                receive electronic Communications pursuant to Section 17.g, we
                will not send User a paper copy of any Communication unless we
                deem it appropriate to do so or User requests such a copy as
                provided below. User can obtain a paper copy of an electronic
                Communication by printing it. We reserve the right, but assume
                no obligation, to provide a paper (instead of electronic) copy
                of any Communication that User has authorized us to provide
                electronically. User may obtain a paper copy of any
                legally-required Communications and or agreements. User may
                request such a paper copy by contacting Wyre
                at support@sendwyre.com
              </li>
              <li>
                How to Withdraw Consent. User may withdraw User’s consent to
                receive Communications in electronic form at any time by
                contacting Wyre at support@sendwyre.com. Any withdrawal of
                User’s consent to receive electronic Communications will be
                effective only after we have received User’s request for
                withdrawal, and have a reasonable period of time to process such
                request. In the meantime, User will continue to receive
                Communications in electronic form. If User withdraws such
                consent, User will no longer be able to participate in the Wyre
                + Rewards Program. Withdrawing consent to receive marketing
                communications only does not preclude participation in the Wyre
                + Rewards Program, however. If User withdraws User’s consent,
                the legal validity and enforceability of prior Communications
                delivered in electronic form will not be affected, and User’s
                previous electronic records will remain accessible for such
                period as is required under law and in a form that allows the
                record to be accurately reproduced to all persons who are
                entitled under law to access the record.
              </li>
              <li>
                Federal Law. User acknowledges and agrees that User’s consent to
                electronic Communications is being provided in connection with a
                transaction affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the
                federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
                Act (“E-SIGN Act”), and that User and we both intend that the
                E-Sign Act apply to the fullest extent possible to validate our
                ability to conduct business with User by electronic means.
              </li>
              <li>
                Termination/Changes. We reserve the right, in our sole
                discretion, to discontinue the provision of User’s electronic
                Communications, or to terminate or change the terms and
                conditions on which we provide electronic Communications. We
                will provide User with notice of any such termination or change
                as required by law.

              <li>
                Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
                agreement between User and Wyre and governs User’s participation
                in the Wyre + Rewards Program, superseding any prior agreements
                between User and Wyre with respect to User’s use of the Site and
                participation in the Wyre + Rewards Program. User may also be

                PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER
                PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY

                WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION; AND EACH OF THE PARTIES
                ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE

              <li>
                Waiver. Wyre’s failure to exercise or enforce or delay in
                exercising or enforcing any right or provision of this Agreement
                shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless
                acknowledged and agreed to by Wyre in writing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Force Majeure. No party shall be liable for failure or delay in
                performing obligations set forth in this Agreement, and no party
                shall be deemed in breach of such obligations, if such failure
                or delay is due to natural disasters or any cause reasonably
                beyond the control of such party.
              </li>
              <li>
                Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are
                solely for the benefit of User and Wyre, and, except as
                specifically provided herein, no third party (including
                creditors of any party) may seek to enforce, or benefit from,
                these provisions, or seek redress for any breach or other
                damage, alleged or proved, under this Agreement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Headings. The section titles in this Agreement are solely used
                for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or
                contractual significance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Severability. Except as provided above regarding the provisions
                hereof relating to Collective Arbitration, if any provision of
                this Agreement, either in whole or in part, is held to be
                illegal, invalid, void as against public policy, or
                unenforceable for any reason under present or future law, such
                provision shall be fully severable without effect on the
                remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and
                effect and remain legal, valid, effective, and enforceable as if
                the illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable provision(s) had
                never comprised a part of such provision or this Agreement, as
                applicable. In lieu of the illegal, invalid, void, or
                unenforceable provision, there shall be added a provision as
                similar in terms and legal effect to the illegal, invalid, void,
                or unenforceable provision as may be possible and which may be
                legal, valid, effective and enforceable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modification of Terms. Wyre reserves the right to modify or
                discontinue all or any portion of the Wyre + Rewards Program
                with or without notice to User. Wyre will not be liable to User
                if we modify or discontinue all or any portion of the Wyre +
                Rewards Program. Wyre may change the terms and conditions of
                this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion upon notice
                provided to you by any of the means contemplated in this
                Agreement. User’s continued use of the Site or participation in
                the Wyre + Rewards Program subsequent to such modification shall
                be deemed an acknowledgment and acceptance thereof.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wyre will not modify the terms
                related to any Participation Amount already contributed without
                User’s consent (except as set forth in Section 5(a) , with
                respect to Wyre + Rewards Rates).
              </li>
              <li>
                Assignment. User may not assign this Agreement or any of your
                rights under this Agreement. We reserve the right to assign our
                rights without restriction, including without limitation to any
                Wyre’s affiliates, or to any successor in interest of any
                business associated with the Wyre + Rewards Program. Any
                attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be
                null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will
                bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors
                and permitted assigns. In the event that Wyre is acquired by or
                merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any
                of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we
                have collected from User as part of such merger, acquisition,
                sale, or other change of control.
              </li>
              <li>
                Relationship of the Parties. Wyre is an independent contractor
                for all purposes. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or
                is intended to, nor shall it, cause User and Wyre to be treated
                as partners, joint ventures, or otherwise as joint associates
                for profit, or either User or Wyre to be treated as the agent of
                the other.
