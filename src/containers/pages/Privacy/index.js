              Personal information is data that can be used to identify you
              directly or indirectly, or to contact you. Our Privacy Policy
              covers all personal information that you voluntarily submit to us
              and that we obtain from our partners. This Privacy Policy does not
              apply to anonymized data that cannot be used to identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only collect personal information with your expressed
              consent and by first notifying you of the purposes for our doing
              so. For every purpose, you will have the option to provide consent
              or not. We collect personal information to provide you with our
              Services. When we require certain personal information from users
              it is because we are required by applicable law to collect this
              information or it is relevant for specified purposes. Any
              information you provide to us that is not required is voluntary.
              You are free to choose whether to provide us with the types of
              personal information requested, but we may not be able to serve
              you as effectively or offer you all of our Services when you do
              choose not to share certain information with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, we collect personal information which is required
              under the law to open an account. We also collect personal
              information when you use or request information about our
              Services, subscribe to communications, request support, or sign up
              for Maui promotions. We may also collect personal information from
              you offline, such as when you contact customer support. We may use
              this information in combination with other information we collect
              about you, as set forth in the Privacy Policy.

                learn more about these technologies, please see the Section of

              <strong>Important Information about Platform Permissions</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain
              types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent.
              And these platforms have different permission systems for
              obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first
              time the Maui app wants permission to access certain types of data
              and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android
              devices will notify you of the permissions that the Maui app seeks
              before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes
              your consent.

              <strong>Deletion Request Rights</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              California residents have the right under the CCPA to request that
              we delete any of their Personal Information that we have collected
              and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and
              confirm a verifiable consumer request (see below), we will delete
              (and direct our service providers to delete) relevant Personal
              Information from our records, unless an exception applies (such as
              the B2B exception referenced above).
            </p>

            <p>
              We may deny California residents’ deletion request if doing so is
              permitted or required by applicable law, or if retaining the
              Personal Information is necessary for us or our service
              provider(s) to:
            </p>

                Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take
                actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
                business relationship with the requesting individual, or
                otherwise perform our contract with a requesting individual;

                statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all
                other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal
                Information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously
                impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided
                informed consent;

                that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

              <strong>Verifiable Consumer Request</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              To exercise the access, portability, and deletion rights under the
              CCPA described above, please submit to us a verifiable consumer
              request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only a California resident may make a verifiable consumer request
              related to their Personal Information. A California resident may
              also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor
              child.
            </p>
            <p>
              A verifiable consumer request for Personal Information access or
              portability can only be made twice within a 12-month period. The
              verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information
              that allows us to reasonably verify the California resident about
              whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized
              representative, and contain sufficient detail that allows us to
              properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot
              respond to your request or provide Personal Information if we
              cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and
              confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to
              create an account on our website. However, we do consider requests
              made through your password protected account sufficiently verified
              when the request relates to Personal Information associated with
              that specific account. We will only use Personal Information
              provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
              requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request
              within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90
              days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in
              writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our
              written response to that account. If you do not have an account
              with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or
              electronically.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
              preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response
              we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
              request, if applicable. For Personal Information portability
              requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal
              Information that is readily useable and should allow you to
              transmit the Personal Information from one entity to another
              entity without hindrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
              consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
              unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
              will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a
              cost estimate before completing your request.
            </p>
