              These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are provided by Maui Finance
              (“Maui”, “us,” “we,” or “our”). and govern our users’ (“you” or
              “User”) use of our website and mobile application (the

              on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms

              entitled “E-SIGN Disclosure and Consent,” your authorization to
              receive any and all communications electronically is a condition
              of these Terms. If you revoke your consent to receive

            <p>
              Maui may not make the Services available in all markets and

              from certain U.S. states or foreign jurisdictions ("Restricted
              Locations"). By using the Services, you represent that you are not
              located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
              Restricted Locations, or any country to which the United States
              prohibits the use of the Services.

              You further represent and warrant that you: (a) are at least 18
              years of age; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed
              from using our Services; (c) have full power and authority to

              as a "Specially Designated National;" (e) are not placed on the
              Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List; and (f) will not use

                IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
              laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial
              institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
              identifies each person who opens an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for
              your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will
              allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's
              license or other identifying documents.

              <strong>ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT DISCLOSURES</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The following disclosures are made in accordance with the federal
              law regarding electronic payments, deposits, transfers of funds
              and other electronic transfers to and from your account(s). There
              may be limitations on account activity that restrict your ability
              to make electronic fund transfers. Any such limits are disclosed
              in the appropriate agreements governing your account. Electronic
              Fund Transfer services may be provided by Maui or by authorized
              third-parties. In each case, you will be notified by prior
              disclosure as to whom the services are provided and any additional
              terms of service that apply.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Definitions: Electronic Fund Transfer: Any transfer of funds,
                other than a transaction originated by check, draft or similar
                paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic device
                or computer to instruct us to debit or credit an account.
                Electronic Fund Transfers include such electronic transactions
                as direct deposits or withdrawals of funds, transfers initiated
                via telephone, website or mobile application. Preauthorized
                Electronic Fund Transfer: An Electronic Fund Transfer that you
                have authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular
                intervals; for example, direct deposits into or withdrawal of
                funds out of your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your Liability: Authorized Transfers: You are liable for all
                Electronic Fund Transfers that you authorize, whether directly
                or indirectly. Unauthorized Transfers: Tell us at once if you
                believe your account or Access Information is lost or stolen or
                has been or may be subject to unauthorized Electronic Fund
                Transfers. Contact us immediately to keep your possible losses
                to a minimum. You could lose all the money in your account(s).
                If you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of
                the loss or theft of your account access device, or after
                learning of any other unauthorized transfers from your account
                involving your account access device, you can lose no more than
                $50 if Electronic Fund Transfers are made without your
                permission. For these transactions, if you DO NOT tell us within
                two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft or
                unauthorized use, and we can establish that we could have
                prevented the unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in
                time, you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your periodic
                account statement shows unauthorized transfers and you DO NOT
                tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was delivered
                to you, you may not get back any money you lose after the sixty
                (60) day period if we can prove that we could have prevented the
                unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in time. If an
                extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or
                hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of a
                suspected lost or stolen access device or of any other suspected
                unauthorized transfer(s), the time periods specified in this
                paragraph may be extended for a reasonable period.

              <strong>ERROR RESOLUTION</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers,
              Telephone us at +1 650 600 1357 or email us support@mauibank.io as
              soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong
              or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the
              statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days
              after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error
              appeared.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).</li>
              <li>
                Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and
                explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or
                why you need more information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</p>
                <p>
                  If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your
                  complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business
                  days after we hear from you and will correct any error
                  promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45
                  days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide
                  to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business
                  days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will
                  have the use of the money during the time it takes us to
                  complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your
                  complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it
                  within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale, or
                  foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to
                  investigate your complaint or question. For new accounts, we
                  may take up to 20 business days to credit your account for the
                  amount you think is in error. We will tell you the results
                  within three business days after completing our investigation.
                  If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a
                  written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents
                  that we used in our investigation.

              We frequently update the products that constitute the Service. The

              described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience

            </p>
            <p>
              Any buying or selling activity is self-directed. That means that
              you are responsible for all purchase and sell orders, decisions to
              implement or maintain an investment strategy, decisions to hold or
              sell digital assets and selection of the type of digital assets to
              hold or sell. You agree that any investment decision you make does
              not rely on any advice from Maui and is at your own risk. You must
              determine the suitability of any trade, investment, investment
              strategy, and risk associated with your trading activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              We publish market prices for eligible digital assets as we receive
              them from unrelated third-party sources. That market price will
              not be a price at which you can buy or sell through the Services.
              The Services may not reflect the best price in active trading
              markets. The current prices at which you can trade include a
              spread (above or below) the market prices sourced from
              third-parties. Any such spread may change from time to time based
              on market conditions and may be different for different types of
              eligible digital assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that Maui may accept or refuse any order, or delay
              placing any order, if Maui determines that it is necessary or
              appropriate to do so. Additionally, you may suffer market losses
              during periods of volatility in the price and trading volume of
              digital assets, particularly when system issues result in the
              inability to buy or sell eligible digital assets. You agree that
              you will not hold Maui responsible for any losses caused by such
              refusal or delay or such inability to buy or sell.

              <strong>RISKS OF USING DIGITAL ASSETS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The risk of loss in holding digital assets can be substantial. You
              should therefore carefully consider whether holding digital assets
              is suitable for you in light of your financial situation. In
              considering whether to hold Digital Assets, you should be aware
              that the price or value of Digital Assets can change rapidly,
              decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is
              not an indicator of future performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maui is not responsible for the market for digital assets, and
              makes no representations or warranties concerning the real or
              perceived value of digital assets as denominated in any currency.
              Although we may provide historical and/or real-time data regarding
              the price of digital assets, such data is for reference only. We
              make no representations regarding the quality, suitability,
              veracity, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data or
              graphs, and you should not rely on such data or graphs for any
              reason whatsoever.

              and shall in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with,
              your decisions. You agree and understand that under no
              circumstances will your use of the Services be deemed to create a
              relationship that includes the provision of or tendering of
              investment advice.

            <p>
              Except where prohibited or limited by applicable law you grant
              Maui the right, without further notice to you, to hold the digital
              assets held in your account in Maui’s name or in another name, and
              to pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or
              otherwise transfer, invest or use any amount of such digital
              assets, separately or together with other property, with all
              attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time and
              without retaining in Maui’s possession and/or control a like
              amount of digital assets, and to use or invest such digital assets
              at its own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge that, with respect to assets used by Maui pursuant
              to this paragraph: (i) you may not be able to exercise certain
              rights of ownership, (ii) Maui may receive compensation in
              connection with lending or otherwise using or investing digital
              assets in its business to which you will have no entitlement, and
              (iii) digital assets that are subject to such transactions will
              not be held by Maui third party custodians.

              We may amend or modify these Terms by updating this page,
              https://Maui.finance/terms-of-service, or emailing to you the
              revised Terms, and the revised Terms shall be effective at such
              time. If you do not agree with any such modification, you must
              terminate your use of the Services and close your account by
              notifying support@mauibank.io . You agree that we are not liable
              to you or any third party for any modification or termination of

            <ol>
              <li>
                Maui is not a bank. Products offered through the service are not
                covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maui is not a money transmitter. All money transmission related
                to Maui Services is performed by Wyre Payments, Inc., a licensed
                and regulated money transmitter. Applicable licenses and
                required disclosures can be found
                at https://www.sendwyre.com/licenses/.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the balance shown in your account is generally accurate,
                it may vary from exactly what you see when you withdraw from
                Maui back to your bank account. In addition to this you also
                recognize that transfer speeds are estimated at 5 business days.
                There are times and situations that may increase or decrease
                this speed dramatically
              </li>
              <li>
                By agreeing to these Terms, you understand that Maui does not
                directly control your assets, and is not responsible for your
                assets. We guide your funds to different businesses that enable
                your funds to have a high rate of return.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must upload valid IDs and your actual information during the
                onboarding process. This is very important for tax and other
                compliance purposes. If you misreport these documents, we will
                be forced to close your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand that interest rates offered by Maui are variable.
                Our interest rate depends on the supply and demand of the
                different lending protocols that we use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maui uses stable coins, which are an experimental technology on
                the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, Maui uses a stable coin
                pegged to the USD. I understand that my accounts balance will
                slightly vary on withdrawal due to this stable coin losing its
                peg from USD.
